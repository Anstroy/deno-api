# Deno API

This repo is just for testing how an API server would look like using
[Deno](https://deno.land/), [Oak](https://deno.land/x/oak@v9.0.0),
[DenoDB](https://eveningkid.com/denodb-docs/), and
[JWT](https://github.com/timonson/djwt) tokens for auth.

## Start server

The script to run the deno server is localed at **./run.sh**

```sh
$ sh run.sh
```
